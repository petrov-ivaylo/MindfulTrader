Here you will be taught an introduction to 'reading the stock market'. First, let's start by the basics:<br>

<h2> What are we trading actually?</h2>
To make sure we are all on the same page about stock trading we will do a small recapitulation of what stock trading is based on. The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place. The goal of a trader is to ‘buy’ a specific item, and sell it at a higher price, making profit from the trade. Stock trading can be trading of multiple items, but usually shares of a company or FOREX (exchange of currency from a country to another). They are the only cases relevant here. A share is a literal part of a company, sold by said company when in need of immediate money. The owner then ‘owns’ a part of the company and is eligible for a part of the revenue of the company. Buying stocks to get money from the owned revenue is called ‘investing’ (however the word will still be used in cases of trading). However, this amount is often insignificant compared  to trading them. Most traders make money from exploiting small differences in values between the current value of the stock and the actual value. For each type of item exchanged, there is a ‘market’, that is open for trades until specific times, allowing any user to purchase or sell stocks. The price of stocks is settled by offer-and-demand. There are multiple platforms that track the value of stocks and help users manage their list of owned shares (portfolio). Our focus here at mindful-trader will be shares of companies of medium size (shares prices going from 10$ to 200$) as well as FOREX given the low amount of money required to begin trading. For day trading (which we are not aiming for) we recommend more than 20.000$ of budget to begin with. It is not something we can ask of our younger users, which is why we focus on longer term profit. It is however still recommended for our users to have at least 1000$ to begin investing.
<br>
<h2>Basics notions, 'value' of a 'share'</h2><br>

The worth of a share of a company is determined by the supply and demand. Traders make almost all of their money from the trades and not by 'owning' the share themselves. To be able to live from the revenue of your shares would require an amount of money to begin with that would be enough to live the rest of your life without working.<br>
Keep in mind then, that the value of a share is the amount of money that you will potentially make by selling it later. The worth of a share is the actual price of the share right now. To know this value you can go to websites like Yahoo Finance or Morningstar which provide real-time information about the price of shares of most companies.<br>
They usually present their data in a simple and understandable form : candles. You will see a graph with the price of a share, with a candle per day/hour/minute. Each candle represents four important values. The 'open', the price of the share when they started recording or when the market opened. The 'close', the price at the end of that period of time. The 'high', the maximum value of the price during that period of time; The 'low', the lowest value the share reached during that period of time. When the price of a stock increases, we say that it is 'bullish', and when it decreases, we call it 'bearish'.<br>

<h2>Patterns</h2><br>
In this section we will look at specific patterns that can help us to determine the likelihood of the price to go up or down. Please keep in mind that those are just indications and their reliability is often debated.

<h3>Shooting stars and Hammers</h3>
These are fairly simple patterns. Shooting stars occur when during a single time span, the price rises high but returns to an even lower position as where it began. It means that a lot of people consider that the current price of the share has reached its peak, and so they sell as fast as possible to maximize their gains. Hammers are the opposite. The price starts to drop because some people believe it has reached its peak, then those shares get bought back immediately, indicating high expectations for this share.<br> The idea here is to follow the flow, as in stock market, when a lot of people are convinced of something, it becomes true (more on that later). Both those patterns are valid on a small scale of time (hours or days) but unreliable on large time spans (weeks/months).<br> 
When the buyers are in power (hammer) the price is increasing and we say that the stock has momentum. When the sellers are stronger (more numerous), the price drops down and we say that there is a resistance as the price will not be allowed to go higher than some value.<br>

<h3>Trend</h3>
The easiest and simplest way of making stock market analysis comes from the overall tendency of the market’s price. If the price of a given share/item is overall increasing over a given span of time t, we say that it is bullish over t. By looking at the tendency of the curve of values over a long enough span of time we can often determine a global direction of the price over a shorter span of time. For example, if the price has been increasing for four months, it is unlikely going to drop during the week to come without prior notice (like the head dying or a global pandemic stopping the economy). This has some draw-backs however. It is a quite safe way of investing, but making trades that will be profitable only after a long span of time reduces the relative income per day (investing 500$ to get 550$ a year later makes 0.14$/day, and that can be considered a very good trade). If this would be a problem for a full-time trader, who is more concerned about profit per day, for our type of user, using the app every two or three days, it is a very reliable way to make profit with a low amount of trades.<br>

<h3>Ceilings and Floors</h3>
This is one of the most, if not the most important pattern. You will often see a periodic pattern in the price of a share, going up then down, then up, reaching almost the same value at its peak every time, and the same value at its lowest too. Like for the shooting star and hammer example, these indicate that the value of the share is estimated between two prices. Most trades are made at this time, as it is easier to evaluate its next price, contained in a box, with a ceiling and a floor. Buying when the value is at the floor is a good thing, as the price will most likely go up again after that. When the price actually breaks either the ceiling or the floor, the rule is broken, and if you own a share while the price is going own, you should sell as soon as possible. The other way, if you own a share and the price broke the ceiling, you made profits, so you are free to sell at the first sign of the price going down again.<br>

<h3>Safety net</h3>
This one resembles the floor for the previous pattern. As a company sells its shares when it is in need of immediate money, they have all interests in keeping their price high. To ensure that, a company often decides on a limit under which the value of their share should not go under. If it reaches this limit, they will actually buy their own shares until it rises up again. For investors, this is a perfect situation, as they are sure that the value of a share will never drop below a certain point. Investing at this instant is an almost guaranteed profit.<br>
<h3>Wedges</h3>
Like with ceiling and floors, these are found when the price seems comprised between two lines, growing further apart/closer. If the price seems to fluctuate more and more between two numbers, investing when it is low is probably a good idea, but with high risks as the price will most likely change a lot. However, when the price is starting to stabilize, then there is almost no money to be made on those trades, and most traders stop caring about this stock until it starts to fluctuate again.<br>
<h3>Moving Average</h3>
The moving average is an estimation of the real value of a stock by taking the average value of a stock over a span of time and comparing it to the value of the stock at its end. This is another indicator to see the overall tendency of the value. If it remains over/under the moving average then it is a strong indicator of a bullish/bearish stock. over a short span of time with no essential news about the company's future being released, it can also give a good estimation of the real value of a share, indicating when the price is overestimated or underestimated. It is also sometimes advised to invest when the curve breaks but like every indicator, it is only a part of the equation and is not a sufficient reason to invest or sell.
