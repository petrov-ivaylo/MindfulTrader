Here you will be taught an introduction to 'reading the stock market'. First, let's start by the basics:<br>

<h2> What are we trading actually?</h2>
First, we need to define how a user can get money from 'investing' in a stock market.<br>
One of the ways to do that is to buy and sell 'shares of a given company. A 'share' of a company is a literal piece of the company. When you own a share of a company, you own a part of the said company. You then have the right to claim a part of their revenue and/or vote in their assemblies to decide the future of the company.<br>
"But why do they allow you to buy a part of their company? Isn't it stupid to give other people rights over your company?"
Well, the companies did not have a choice in most cases. To start your company, you need a big amount of usable money, and to get this amount, they offer to buy a part of their company in exchange of investment that they can use right now. The parts sold this way ar ethe shares, and they keep being sold and bought again and again accordingly to the value of the company itself. If the company is making a lot of money, a small amount will go in your pocket, so the share is expensive. If the company is making no money, their share has no value. Investing in the stock market (at least in our case here on Mindful Trader) consists of that, selling and buying shares.<br>
<br>
<h2>Basics notions, 'value' of a share'</h2><br>

The worth of a share of a company is determined by the supply and demand. Investors make almost all of their money from the trades themselves and not by 'owning' the share themselves. To be able to live from the revenue of your shares would require an amount of money to begin with that would be enough to live the rest of your life without working.<br>
Keep in mind then, that the value of a share is the amount of money that you will potentially make by selling it later. The worth of a share is the actual pric eof the share right now. To know this value you can go to websites like Yahoo Finance or Morningstar that provide real-time information about the price of shares of most companies.<br>
They usually present their data in a simple and understandable form : candles. You will see a graph with the price of a share, with a candle per day/hour/minute. Each candle represents four important values. The 'open', the price of the share when they started recording or when the market opened. The 'close', the price at the end of that period of time. The 'high', the maximum value of the price during that period of time; The 'low', the lowest value the share reached during that period of time.<br>

<h2>Patterns</h2><br>
In this section we will look at specific patterns that can help us to determine the likelihood of the price to go up or down. Please keep in mind that those are just indications and their reliability is often debated.
<h3>Shooting stars and Hammers</h3>
These are fairly simple patterns. Shooting stars occur when during a single time span, the price rises high but returns to an even lower position as where it began. It means that a lot of people consider that the current price of the share has reached its peak, and so they sell as fast as possible to maximize their gains. Hammers are the opposite. The price starts to drop because some people believe it has reached its peak, then those shares get bought back immediately, indicating high expectations for this share.<br> The idea here is to follow the flow, as in stock market, when a lot of people are convinced of something, it becomes true (more on that later). Both those patterns are valid on a small scale of time (hours or days) but unreliable on large time spans (weeks/months).<br> 

<h3>Trend</h3>
Again, this is a fairly good indicator. If the price has been going up for two years now, it is safe to assume it is most likely not going down over night. However, the main concern here is the scale. Even if the price is going up, investing 1000$ now, getting in return 2000$, if it takes three years, only means 55$/month for a 1000$ investment, and this is in a perfect case. That is also why most transactions are made by computers and highly experienced traders, over small time spans (often measurable in seconds).

<h3>Ceilings and Floors</h3>
This is one of the most, if not the most important pattern. You will often see a periodic pattern in the price of a share, going up then down, then up, reaching almost the same value at its peak every time, and the same value at its lowest too. Like for the shooting star and hammer example, these indicate that the value of the share is estimated between two prices. Most trades are made at this time, as it is easier to evaluate its next price, contained in a box, with a ceiling and a floor. Buying when the value is at the floor is a good thing, as the price will most likely go up again after that. When the price actually breaks either the ceiling or the floor, the rule is broken, and if you own a share while the price is going own, you should sell as soon as possible. The other way, if you own a share and the price broke the ceiling, you made profits, so you are free to sell at the first sign of the price going down again.<br>

<h3>Safety net</h3>
This one ressembles the floor for the previous pattern. As a company sells its shares when it is in need of immediate money, they have all interests in keeping their price high. To ensure that, a company often decides on a limit under which the value of their share should not go under. If it reaches this limit, they will actually buy their own shares until it rises up again. For investors, this is a perfect situation, as they are sure that the value of a share will never drop below a certain point. Investing at this instant is an almost guaranteed profit.<br>
<h3>Wedges</h3>
Like with ceiling and floors, these are found when the price seems comprised between two lines, growing further apart/closer. If the price seems to fluctuate more and more between two numbers, investing when it is low is probably a good idea, but with high risks as the price will most likely change a lot. However, when the price is starting to stabilize, then there is almost no money to be made on those trades, and most investors stop caring about this stock until it starts to fluctuate again.<br>
